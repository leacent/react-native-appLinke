# react-native-appLinke

This is a trial development to develop an app for an existing web project, which is built with webpack+react+flux.

Just think react-native as the view layer(like `V` in mvc), the other business logic like `M` and `C` (in mvc) can be using as a common module between the browser and app. So if I want to build a react-native app upon an existing react project, approximately, the only job i have to do is just to rebuild the view ! That's extremely simply the job!


### Note

This is just an beginning...
